You are given an array of strings arr of size n. You have to find out if it is possible to make a palindromic string by concatenating the strings in any order. Provided that all the strings given in the array are of equal length.

Example 1:

Input:
n = 4
arr = {"djfh", "gadt", "hfjd", "tdag"}
Output:
YES
Explanation:
You can make the string "djfhgadttdaghfjd", by concatenating the given strings which is a palindrome.
Example 2:

Input:
n = 3
arr = {"jhjdf", "sftas", "fgsdf"}
Output:
NO
Explanation:
You can't make a palindromic string with this strings.
Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function makePalindrome() which takes an integer n and an array of strings arr respectively and returns true or false.

Expected Time Complexity: O(n * len(arr[i]))
Expected Space Complexity: O(n * len(arr[i]))

Constraints:
1 <= n <= 104
0 <= |arr[i]| <= 104
The sum of n*|arr[i]| over all test cases won't exceed 106
