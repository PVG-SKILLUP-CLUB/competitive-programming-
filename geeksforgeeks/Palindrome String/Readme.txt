Given a string S, check if it is palindrome or not.

Example 1:

Input: S = "abba" 
Output: 1 
Explanation: S is a palindrome

Example 2:

Input: S = "abc" 
Output: 0 
Explanation: S is not a palindrome

Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Complete the function isPalindrome()which accepts string S and returns an integer value 1 or 0.

Expected Time Complexity: O(Length of S)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Constraints:
1 <= Length of S<= 2*10^5
